Sure â€” here's the GitHub issue written for you, ready to copy and paste:

---

**Title:** ðŸš€ Feature Request: Support Recursive Directory Search and Multiple Files

---

**Description:**
Currently, `java-grep` accepts only a single file as input, which limits its usability when working with directories or multiple files. Users must manually run the program for each file they want to search, which is inefficient and not scalable.

**Suggested Enhancement:**

* Allow passing a directory as an argument and recursively search all files within it.
* Accept multiple files or a mix of files and directories as input.
* When searching through multiple files, include the filename in the output to distinguish matches.
* Optionally add a flag (e.g. `-r` or `--recursive`) to explicitly enable recursive search.

**Why this is useful:**
This would bring the tool more in line with the behavior of standard Unix `grep -r`, making it far more useful for real-world projects where source files are organized into directories. It would also reduce friction when trying to search across entire codebases or document trees.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
java Search <pattern> src/
java Search <pattern> file1.txt file2.txt
java Search -r <pattern> ./logs/
```

Let me know if you'd like help designing or implementing this feature â€” happy to contribute!

Let me know if you want me to create a second one, maybe about error handling or adding regex support.
